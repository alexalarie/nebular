To install NEBULAR, change to the "src/" directory, and type 'make'.
The executable, 'nebular', can be copied anywhere in your path.


Before you run NEBULAR, you must set the NEBULAR environment variable,
so that NEBULAR can find its data tables:


for bash:
export NEBULAR=/somepath/nebular-1.0/data/

for cshrc:
setenv NEBULAR /somepath/nebular-1.0/data/

You may permanently set this in ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc
