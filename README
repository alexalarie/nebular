NEBULAR is a lightweight code to synthesize the spectrum of a
mixed hydrogen helium gas in collisional ionization equilibrium. 
It is not a spectral fitting code, but it can be used to resample 
a model spectrum onto the wavelength grid of a real observation.

Supported are a wide range of temperatures and densities.
NEBULAR includes free-free, free-bound, two-photon and line emission
from HI, HeI and HeII. The code will either return the composite
model spectrum, or - if desired - the unrescaled atomic emission 
coefficients.

WARNING:
Ionization fractions are calculated by solving the Saha equation.
These fractions might be far off the real values in a true astrophysical
nebula; the fractions can be overridden on the command-line using
user-supplied values.
NEBULAR is not a photo-ionization code; if you want that, you must use 
something much more sophisticated such as CLOUDY.

EXAMPLE runs can be found in the appendix of

This paper also serves as the primary documentation.

To get a list of command-line options, run the nebular executable 
without arguments.
